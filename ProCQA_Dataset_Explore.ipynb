When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...\\n\",\n",

            "    \"answer\": \"This warning is there because Java is not actually storing type information at run-time in an object that uses generics.  Thus, if object is actually a List<String>, there will be no ClassCastException at run-time except until an item is accessed from the list that doesn't match the generic type defined in the variable.  \\nThis can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  \\nTo remove the warning, try:\\nList<?> list = (List<?>) object;\\n\\nHowever, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.  The above will work in a lot of situations, but if you have to use add, or some similarly restricted method, you will just have to suffer the yellow underline in Eclipse (or a SuppressWarning annotation).\\n\"\n",

            "    \"question\": \"Is there a way to create a JButton with your own button graphic and not just with an image inside the button? \\nIf not, is there another way to create a custom JButton in java?\\n\",\n",
            "    \"answer\": \"When I was first learning Java we had to make Yahtzee and I thought it would be cool to create custom Swing components and containers instead of just drawing everything on one JPanel.  The benefit of extending Swing components, of course, is to have the ability to add support for keyboard shortcuts and other accessibility features that you can't do just by having a paint() method print a pretty picture.  It may not be done the best way however, but it may be a good starting point for you.\\nEdit 8/6 - If it wasn't apparent from the images, each Die is a button you can click. This will move it to the DiceContainer below.  Looking at the source code you can see that each Die button is drawn dynamically, based on its value.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are the basic steps:\\n\\nCreate a class that extends JComponent\\nCall parent constructor super() in your constructors\\nMake sure you class implements MouseListener\\nPut this in the constructor:\\nenableInputMethods(true);   \\naddMouseListener(this);\\n\\nOverride these methods:\\npublic Dimension getPreferredSize()  \\npublic Dimension getMinimumSize()  \\npublic Dimension getMaximumSize()\\n\\nOverride this method:\\npublic void paintComponent(Graphics g)\\n\\n\\nThe amount of space you have to work with when drawing your button is defined by getPreferredSize(), assuming getMinimumSize() and getMaximumSize() return the same value.  I haven't experimented too much with this but, depending on the layout you use for your GUI your button could look completely different.\\nAnd finally, the source code.  In case I missed anything.  \\n\"\n",
